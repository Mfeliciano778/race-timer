# TDD Assignment

When you're ready to work on this, let me know. I'll pair you up with someone else who's ready and put you in a breakout room to work on it as a team.

1. clone this repo
2. npm install
3. run npm test to see the results
4. create a suite for each component in the app
5. write a test to make sure that each component renders
6. pick lines of code that aren't covered (according to the coverage report)
7. work on writing tests for those uncovered lines.
